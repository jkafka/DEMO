# **Detecting IPV-related Suicides in NVDRS**

This website serves as a resource for those who wish to use the IPV classifier tool to detect IPV circumstances for suicide, which was developed as part of Julie M Kafka's dissertation (2022).


## How to use

All you need to run the IPV Classifier is:

1. Your copy of the Restricted Access Datafiele (RAD) for the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). The NVDRS RAD is available upon request from [the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/datasources/nvdrs/dataaccess.html).

2. Our Concept Term Lists, which is available to download from the [Resources tab](https://crumplab.github.io/LabJournalWebsite/Journal.html). #JK TO UPDATE LINK

3. The IPV Classifier model itself, also available to download from the [Resources tab](https://crumplab.github.io/LabJournalWebsite/Journal.html). #JK TO UPDATE LINK
